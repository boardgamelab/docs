# Properties

A **property** is a piece of data that you can attach to a component instance.
Properties are useful for organizing data for both the layout of the component as well
as the rules associated with it.

## Types of properties

### Text

Title text, descriptions etc. are typical uses of a **text** property.

### Image

Useful when you want to associate a different image with each component instance
(that you can subsequently pull into the layout).

### Number

A numeric attribute (a card cost or attack value, for example).

### Boolean

Boolean properties can be either **Yes** or **No**. These are typically
used as switches to turn on / off layers and also inside rules.
