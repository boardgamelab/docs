# Properties

A **property** is a piece of data that you can attach to a component.
Data from properties can be embedded in the layout of the component.
Properties are also frequently manipulated in [rules](./rules).

## Types of properties

### Text

Title text, descriptions etc. are typical uses of a **text** property.

### Image

Useful when you want to associate a different image with each component instance
(that you can subsequently pull into the layout).

### Number

A numeric attribute (a card cost or attack value, for example).

### Boolean

Boolean properties can be either **Yes** or **No**. These are typically
used as switches to turn on / off layers or rule conditions.
