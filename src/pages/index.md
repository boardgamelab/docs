# About

Boardgame Lab is a browser-based tool that allows you to create and play
board games online.

### Prototyping

The built-in editor allows you to create and edit layouts on the fly (even mid-game).
Components are created by joining these layouts with data from a spreadsheet, allowing
you to create create hundreds of components in minutes. Edits to a layout are applied
automatically to all components that inherit from it immediately, saving you precious
time while experimenting with your game design.

### Playtesting

Playtest by simply sharing a link (no account required for your playtesters). The
platform works on all platforms, including mobile devices with tiny screens.

### Automation

Choose between sandbox-style play, full rules enforcement or anything between. The
rules editor allows you to script your entire game without writing a single line of code.
The platform also provides bots that can play your game automatically.
